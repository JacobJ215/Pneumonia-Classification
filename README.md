# Pneumonia-Classification

This project was insprired in part of the RSNA Pneumonia Detection [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/overview) challenge, where the challenge was to create an algorithm that automatically detects potential pneumonia cases.

Hereâ€™s the backstory and why solving this problem matters.

Pneumonia accounts for over 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old internationally. In 2015, 920,000 children under the age of 5 died from the disease. In the United States, pneumonia accounts for over 500,000 visits to emergency departments and over 50,000 deaths in 2015, keeping the ailment on the list of top 10 causes of death in the country.
